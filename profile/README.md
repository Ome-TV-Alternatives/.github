## How to Protect Yourself on These Platforms

Safety comes first when chatting with strangers online. Here‚Äôs how I keep secure on OmeTV and its alternatives:

### Always Use a VPN
I never hop onto random video chat sites without a VPN (Virtual Private Network). It masks my IP address and location, shielding my personal info from prying eyes. Without this, strangers could potentially pinpoint my location or exploit my network.

Look for a VPN with a **no-logs policy**‚Äîno activity tracking means extra peace of mind. Free VPNs often skimp on security, so I‚Äôd rather spend a few bucks monthly for solid protection.

My go-to is **[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/SH5kU)**‚Äîit‚Äôs fast, reliable, and the cheapest premium option out there right now.
